# Proteogenomics Workshop at the NordBioNet Summer School 2021

## Wrap-up

Before embarking on a proteogenomics project, ask yourself some important questions...

1. What are the underlying assumptions of my question?
	- RNA vs. protein correlation
	- Gene expression patterns

1. Does the experimental design allow answering my question?
	- Transversal vs. longitudinal
	- Number of samples

1. Is the proteomics lab equipped to process my samples?
	- High resolution high throughput
	- Fractionation

1. Do I have access to the infrastructure, tools, and expertise needed to analyse and interpret the data?
	- High computational power
	- Complex pipelines

1. Are the resources available to interpret my data?
	- Well documented organism and sample
	- Quality of the reference data
